// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The BC7 store only ever helps once something ASKS for a uuid: the interest list has to reach the object, the fetcher has to want the texture and the pipeline has to decide it is wanted, and only then is the store consulted. On arriving somewhere you have been before, the bytes are already on the local disk in the exact form the GPU wants them, and the viewer sits waiting for the network to tell it something it already knows.
//
// A MANIFEST IS A LIST OF UUIDS, NEVER A COPY OF THE BYTES, and that is the whole design (doc/super_compressed_textures.md, "Q1: why manifests beat physical region/agent data files"). The same bodies, kits and building textures recur across regions, so a physical per-region file would multiply the store by the number of places a texture is seen, for nothing a list of uuids does not already deliver. Sixteen bytes per uuid buys the teleport warm-up, the semantic eviction pin and shared-asset correctness all at once.
//
// SCOPE. Region manifests only. Agent manifests are the same mechanism keyed by avatar uuid and hooked at processAvatarAppearance instead of region change, and are deliberately NOT built here - the read path, the cap policy and the file format below are all key-agnostic, so adding them later is a second filename prefix and a second recorder rather than a second design.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Where it lives, and the shape of the file
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// INSIDE the BC7 store's own directory rather than in the region object cache's .roc file, and the reason is ownership rather than convenience. ssroccache.h does define a manifest section id, and folding this in there is a sensible consolidation ONCE ROC HAS SETTLED - but a texture manifest is a Squeeze concern that merely happens to be keyed by region, and putting it in ROC's file would make every ROC format change a Squeeze format change. Living under bc7cache also buys the privacy requirement for free: SSBC7Store::purgeAll is a recursive deleteDirAndContents of the store directory, so "clear cache" takes the record of where you went with it, which is the fourth of the four critical fixes and not something to re-litigate per subdirectory.

A manifest is not a queue - it is a description of a place, read back once, in full, on the next visit - so age says nothing useful about an entry and area says everything: the textures that dominate video memory in a region are the ones that covered the most screen there. So the cap sacrifices the LIGHTEST entries, the ones only ever glimpsed at a few pixels across, which are simultaneously the cheapest to forget and the least missed. Every drop is counted and the running total is written into the manifest header, so a readout can say "at least this many" rather than implying it remembered everything.
