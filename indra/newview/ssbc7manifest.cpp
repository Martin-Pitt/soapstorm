// WHERE EVERY PIECE OF THIS RUNS, because the split is forced rather than chosen.
//
// The TICK, the RECORDER and the PRE-WARM are main thread: gAgent, gTextureList, LLViewerTextureManager and the read path's request stage are all main-thread affairs, and the recorder in particular must be on the thread that already owns the texture list rather than on a fetch thread, because a fetch thread taking a per-texture lock to file a uuid would put this feature's cost squarely on the path it exists to shorten.
//
// The LOAD and the SAVE are the only file IO, and both go on the existing BC7Encode pool through ssBC7EncodeTryPost. Not a new pool: a third one would be more shutdown ordering to get wrong for work nobody is waiting on. Not the reader pool either, because that one exists to gate visible textures and an 80 KB manifest write has no business queueing ahead of one. Background QoS is exactly right for a write nobody waits on, and for a read that has whole seconds of teleport screen to complete in.
//
// NOTHING HERE EVER ORIGINATES SIMULATOR OR ASSET TRAFFIC. The pre-warm only ever touches a uuid the store already has a record for; a manifest entry with no record is counted and dropped, and is a want-list candidate at most. That is the difference between a warm-up and a speculative download.
