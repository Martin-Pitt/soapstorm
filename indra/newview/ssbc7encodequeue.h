// Everything that decides whether a decoded texture becomes a BC7 record, and the pool that does the work.
//
// This is deliberately a set of free functions over one file-static state object rather than an LLSingleton: the consider entry point is called from the texture fetch thread, and LLSingleton's first-touch construction is a main-thread affair. The state is created once on the main thread and then never destroyed, so a fetch thread reading it during shutdown finds a closed pool rather than freed memory.

// Why a given texture was or was not enqueued. Every one of these is counted and periodically logged, because a bare rejection makes "the feature is off" and "the feature ran and declined everything" look identical from a log file - which is precisely the failure this project has already paid for once.

// Main thread. Re-reads the SSSqueeze settings into the cached policy so the gate can be flipped without a restart. The fetch thread only ever reads these cached values, never gSavedSettings.
void ssBC7EncodeRefreshPolicy();

// Main thread. Stops accepting work and tells any worker already inside an encode to give up at its next check. Encodes are ABANDONED rather than drained at quit: the work queue drains itself before it closes, so without an abandon flag a full queue of megapixel encodes would be executed in full while the user waits for the window to disappear.
void ssBC7EncodeBeginShutdown();

// Main thread. Closes and joins the pool. Must run BEFORE SSBC7Store::shutdownStore(), because every in-flight append belongs to a worker that this call is what waits for. Idempotent.
void ssBC7EncodeShutdown();

// Any thread, in practice the texture fetch thread from the DONE state. Applies every gate and either posts the encode or records why it did not.
//
// MUST NOT BLOCK. The caller holds LLTextureFetchWorker::mWorkMutex for the whole of doWork, so anything that parked here would park every texture in the world behind it: the post is a tryPost, the store lookup takes only the store's map lock, and no file IO happens on this thread at all. A verdict other than SSBC7_ENQUEUED always means the texture carries on down the ordinary uncompressed path exactly as it does today.

// <SS:Nexii> Squeeze eviction - main thread, every frame, and almost always a clock comparison and nothing else. It owns the two jobs that have to happen on the frame thread and nowhere else: marking every texture the running viewer still references, which is the only way a permanently resident texture ever looks warm, and posting the eviction pass onto THIS pool rather than a second one - a WorkQueue post made from inside the store's own lock is how a deadlock gets written, so appendBlob only ever raises a flag and this is what reads it.

It is a set of small accessors rather than a second queue on purpose: promotion work has to share the DEMAND path's pool, its bounded queue, its pinned-bytes budget and its in-flight dedupe set, because two pools would mean a backfill encode could sit ahead of a texture the user is looking at, and two budgets would mean the 256 MB ceiling on pinned raws is really 512 MB.

// <SS:Nexii> Squeeze adaptive quality - `quality` is the profile to encode at, chosen by the caller rather than read here, because the two callers want different answers: the demand path wants whatever the controller has settled on this second, while the idle upgrade pass always wants the best rung. `allow_supersede` is what lets that pass replace an existing record; it is false everywhere else, so the plain-uuid dedupe the demand path relies on is unchanged.
