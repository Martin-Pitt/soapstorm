// WARNING: purge() is called by LLPurgeDiskCacheThread. As such it must
// NOT touch any LLDiskCache data without introducing and locking a mutex!

// Interaction through the filesystem itself should be safe. Let's say thread
// A is accessing the cache file for reading/writing and thread B is trimming
// the cache. Let's also assume using llifstream to open a file and
// boost::filesystem::remove are not atomic (which will be pretty much the
// case).

// Now, A is trying to open the file using llifstream ctor. It does some
// checks if the file exists and whatever else it might be doing, but has not
// issued the call to the OS to actually open the file yet. Now B tries to
// delete the file: If the file has been already marked as in use by the OS,
// deleting the file will fail and B will continue with the next file. A can
// safely continue opening the file. If the file has not yet been marked as in
// use, B will delete the file. Now A actually wants to open it, operation
// will fail, subsequent check via llifstream.is_open will fail, asset will
// have to be re-requested. (Assuming here the viewer will actually handle
// this situation properly, that can also happen if there is a file containing
// garbage.)

// Other situation: B is trimming the cache and A wants to read a file that is
// about to get deleted. boost::filesystem::remove does whatever it is doing
// before actually deleting the file. If A opens the file before the file is
// actually gone, the OS call from B to delete the file will fail since the OS
// will prevent this. B continues with the next file. If the file is already
// gone before A finally gets to open it, this operation will fail and the
// asset will have to be re-requested.

// <SS:Nexii> Strata - this function now drives THREE things off one directory walk: the pack pass that folds settled loose files into volumes, the accounting that makes the budget cover both tiers, and the drain that takes the cache back under its watermark. The walk is the expensive part on a cache of this size, and giving the packer its own would have cost more than the container saves.
//
// The drain is the only genuinely new policy here. Loose files are individually deletable and a volume is not, so the two tiers are drained oldest-first against each other: the coldest sealed volume is offered its own bytes-weighted mean use day against the mtime of the oldest loose file still standing, and whichever is older goes. The store declines by NAME - TOO_YOUNG, ALL_HOT, COOLDOWN - so a purge that could not free anything says which of those it was instead of silently doing nothing.
