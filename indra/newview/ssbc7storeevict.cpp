// Third of the store's three files, and the only one that decides anything. ssbc7store.cpp knows what the bytes MEAN and depends on nothing; ssbc7storeio.cpp knows where they GO and owns every handle, every path and the one delete; this file knows which of them are worth keeping. It deliberately performs no file IO of its own - it calls appendIndexRecords and killSegmentFile and nothing else - so that the answer to "what can this feature delete" stays confined to one function in one file.
//
// RECLAIM IS ALWAYS ONE WHOLE SEGMENT. Blob bytes are never read, moved or rewritten: the writer is a pure log and records are immutable per (uuid, encoder_version), so a segment is exactly "the textures first seen during one window of time" and contains no overwrite garbage a copy-forward pass could harvest. Copying live blobs out of a doomed segment would therefore spend real read and write IO on data it merely BELIEVES is hot, while dropping the record spends CPU only on the blobs demand later proves hot - and it spends it on a decode the viewer was doing anyway, because ssBC7EncodeConsider fires on every full-resolution DONE decode and is suppressed only by hasRecord(). Re-encode IS this design's copy phase, performed lazily and only for what came back.
