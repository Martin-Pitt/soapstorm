// The ROC is a FullID-keyed sidecar store layered over an untouched LLVOCache/.slc - it never reads or writes the protocol cache, and its own format is versioned per file so it can iterate without inflicting a global object-cache wipe on users. Rationale and the full design live in doc/region_object_cache.md.

constexpr U32 SSROC_MAGIC             = 0x434f5253; // 'SROC' as stored little-endian
// <SS:Nexii> 6 -> 7 for a SEMANTIC change rather than a layout one, which is a reason to bump this that the line below does not cover and is worth stating so nobody "optimises" the bump away.
//
// Version 6 files predate the epoch flags. A record in one carries neither ID_CURRENT nor ID_STALE, and absent-both reads as "not stale", so every such record is injectable. That is wrong for a specific and reachable file: one saved by a build with no epoch logic, on a visit that saw a restart, which therefore stamped the NEW CacheID into the header while its records still held ids from before it. On the next visit the CacheID compares equal, mode A passes, nothing is marked stale, and remembered ids from a dead epoch get painted - the exact case the epoch flags exist to refuse.
//
// Discarding is right rather than merely easy here. There is no in-file evidence that separates a safe version 6 file from that one, so a migration would have to guess, and ROC data is derived: the cost is that ghosts stay quiet for one visit per region while the ledger records them again.
// <SS:Nexii> 7 -> 8 for the same reason the last bump happened, applied to a surface where the consequence is larger. Version 7 records may carry NEITHER epoch bit, which reads as "not stale" and therefore as injectable. That was survivable while the only consumer was ghost painting, where a wrong guess shows the user a stale object for ninety seconds. It is not survivable now that the same record set answers the simulator's ObjectUpdateCached probes: a record whose stored local id belongs to a dead epoch would claim a CRC match for an object that is no longer there, and the viewer would then never request the object that actually is. Discarding is right rather than merely easy, exactly as before - nothing in a version 7 file separates a safe record from that one, and ROC data is derived, so the cost is one cold visit per region while the ledger records it again.
constexpr U32 SSROC_FORMAT_VERSION    = 8;         // bump on ANY layout change - files from an older version are rejected outright as DATA, never migrated, but see SSROC_MIN_SALVAGE_VERSION below for the one thing that is carried across
// <SS:Nexii> The oldest version whose [OBJECTS] record layout is byte-identical to this one, and therefore the oldest file whose TENURE can be read back after a bump. Both bumps so far were semantic rather than structural - verified field by field against the version 7 serialiser in commit cc6a9040d6 - so a version 6 or 7 file parses exactly, and everything either bump was actually about is thrown away by ssROCStripToTenure rather than trusted.
//
// This exists because discarding the whole file was costing the feature the one thing it cannot rebuild. The promotion pipeline's conservative path needs a record confirmed on SSROCPromoteDaysUnproven DISTINCT CALENDAR DAYS, and calendar days can only be earned by waiting - so a format bump does not cost "one cold visit per region", it resets every record on the grid to day one and pushes promotion three more days into the future. The format moved twice in one week and the owner's ledger has therefore never held a record older than a day, which is exactly why nothing has ever promoted.
//
// Salvage is safe precisely because it keeps the complement of what the bumps were about. Both bumps concerned the meaning of a stored LOCAL ID against a simulator cache epoch; tenure is FullID-keyed presence history that no epoch can invalidate. The blob, the local id, the CRC, the update flags, the score, the promotion flag and both epoch bits are dropped, so a salvaged record can be neither painted (ssROCBuildInjectPlan refuses an empty blob) nor offered to the protocol cache (ssROCBuildSeedPlan refuses it as SSROC_SEED_NO_BLOB), and the file's own CacheID is nulled so the visit reads as SSROC_BACK_EPOCH_UNKNOWN. It carries history and nothing that could stand an object anywhere.

// The ROC already stores everything an .slc entry holds and more - the byte-identical data-packer blob, the CRC the simulator last named, the local id, the update flags the .slc disk format does not even have - so keeping a second copy of the same objects on disk buys nothing. When SSROCBackObjectCache is on, LLViewerRegion::loadObjectCache fills its entry map from these records instead of from the .slc, and the protocol code above it is untouched: probeCache and cacheFullUpdate read a map and neither knows nor cares where it came from.
//
// SEEDING IS NOT PAINTING, and the distinction is the whole safety argument. A seeded entry is created INVALID, exactly as one read from the .slc is, so it is inert until the simulator's own probe validates it. It therefore carries no promotion gate, no recency window and no disqualifier test - a physical object belongs in the protocol cache precisely as much as it belongs in the .slc, and withholding it would only turn a probe hit into a request the simulator did not have to answer.

// Why a record may not be handed to the protocol object cache. A CLOSED set, counted per region and reported by name, because a bare refusal on this path is indistinguishable from a cache that was never warm - and the difference is visible to the simulator as request traffic.
