# Long Sound Upload (SS:Nexii)

Sounds longer than the grid clip limit (30s SL / 60s OpenSim) are split into parts and uploaded as `name 01`, `name 02`, … instead of being rejected. Part count is `ceil(length / limit)` so the L$ cost is minimal either way. By default each part is cut at max length with a shorter final part; Preferences > Soapstorm > Sounds has a checkbox (`FSLongSoundUploadEqualSplits`) to cut near-equal parts instead, for when a stubby tail is awkward to sequence.

Every encoded sound (split or not) gets a 10ms fade-in/out applied during vorbis encoding (`LLVORBIS_CLIP_FADE_TIME`). This kills clicks at clip edges generally, and because split segments run through the same encoder, the cut points are de-clicked for free — the splitter itself is a plain PCM copy.

## Loudness normalization (LUFS)

`sslufs.cpp` implements ITU-R BS.1770-4 gated integrated loudness (K-weighting biquads with de-quantized coefficients so any sample rate works; 400ms blocks at 75% overlap; -70 LUFS absolute and -10 LU relative gates; clips under 400ms measure as a single block).

**Uploads** (`FSNormalizeSoundUploads`, default on; target `FSSoundTargetLUFS`, default -23 like EBU R128 / the common games standard): the mono downmix the encoder will actually upload is measured, and a single linear gain moves it onto the target during encoding, before the edge fades, with samples clamped against clipping. Long sounds are measured once over the whole original so all split parts share the same gain and levels match across cuts. Silence (nothing above the absolute gate) is left untouched.

**Downloaded sounds** (`FSNormalizeDownloadedSounds`, default off): fresh asset decodes are normalized on the General thread pool inside the decode worker, so the sound cache `.dsf` and the in-memory buffer are born normalized. Sounds already cached from before play immediately as-is while a background worker measures the cache file; if it is off-target by more than 0.5 LU the file is rewritten and the live sound is in-flight patched: `LLAudioEngine::reloadSoundBuffer` swaps the buffer under the existing `LLAudioSource` (so loop, trigger vs. attached, position, gain, and sync semantics are preserved untouched) and resumes each playing channel at its captured PCM byte position via FMOD `get/setPosition`. Viewer UI sounds (`UISnd*`) are exempt from all download processing. Each asset is checked at most once per session.

## Test plan (loudness)

- Upload a quiet and a loud wav with normalization on: both come out at ~-23 LUFS integrated (verify in Audacity: Analyze > Measure loudness, or re-import the played sound).
- Upload a long sound: all split parts have identical relative levels across the cut points.
- Set the target slider to a different LUFS: next upload uses the new target; spinner and slider stay in sync.
- Enable downloaded-sound normalization, play an old loud cached sound: it starts at original volume, then within a moment hot-swaps to normalized loudness *at the same playback position*; a looping sound keeps looping, an attached sound stays attached.
- UI sounds (clicks, alerts) are unaffected.
- Disable the option: no cache rewrites occur.

## Test plan

- Upload a valid wav under 30s via Build > Upload > Sound: behaves as before, but the encoded ogg has faded edges (no click on loop/end).
- Upload a wav over 30s via Upload > Sound: a confirmation dialog reports part count and total L$ cost; accepting uploads `name 01..NN`, each ≤ 30s, cuts click-free when played back-to-back.
- Bulk upload (Upload > Bulk) with a long wav in the mix: cost estimate counts each part; upload produces the numbered parts without any encode failure.
- Invalid wavs (wrong rate, non-PCM, truncated chunk) still show their original error notifications.
- On OpenSim grids the limit is 60s; splitting kicks in only past that.
- Toggle the equal-splits checkbox in Preferences > Soapstorm > Sounds: a 70s upload gives 30s + 30s + 10s parts unchecked, ~23.3s x3 checked.
