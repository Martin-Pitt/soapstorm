class LLProcessorInfoImpl;

// <SS:Nexii> Baseline instruction set check.
//
// These are deliberately free functions built on raw __cpuid rather than members of LLProcessorInfo, because LLProcessorInfo answers its hasSSE*() queries by string lookup into a per-platform map that is populated differently on Windows, Linux and macOS, and constructing it measures the CPU frequency by busy-waiting 50ms at realtime priority. The startup guard has to run before any of that, cannot afford the delay, and must not depend on the map having been populated correctly.
//
// AVX support cannot be read from the CPUID feature bit alone: the OS must also have enabled YMM state save/restore, which is why hasAVX() checks OSXSAVE and XGETBV as well. A CPU with the AVX bit set under an OS that never enabled the state will fault on the first VEX-256 instruction.
